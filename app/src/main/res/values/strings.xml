    <string name="help_menu">This app provides you with help to monitor your house on vacations or even when you are gone for
        short periods of time. With me, all you have to do is sign in, copy the ID to your primary phone, and you are done! Just
        position me at the spot you want to monitor in your house, and I will automatically notify you if any changes occur. I do this
        through image processing algorithms and machine learning, and I also save all the information to the cloud, in case a
        burglary does occur. If you have any questions, just call 1-408-637-0864.</string>
